      <div class="title">Research & Planning</div>
      <div class="Persona">
        <h1>Persona</h1>
        <h2>To start off, we created a provisional persona with the needs of using the CRA website, based on our understanding of people who used the CRA online services. This persona was created with assumptions and not entirely research-based, but it was something that I came back to throughout my project to guide my design decisions and priorities.</h2>
        <div class="Persona_img"></div>
      </div>

      <div class="title">Defining the Problem</div>
      <div class="Problem">
        <h1>Analysis</h1>
        <h2>We conducted a heuristic evaluation of navigation and the pages' UI, which our user persona would go through, to detect usability issues and identify ways to resolve them. To make the understanding of how and why something should work as straightforward as possible, we annotated with red-lining on each page of the user path.</h2>
        <div class="Analysis_img"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="Competitor">
        <h1>Competitor Anlaysis</h1>
        <h2>I tested the navigation and main pages for two other government websites. IRS is a direct competitor, and one indirect competitor is the City of Kansas City. The purple number is the usability score based on a 1-5 scale, from (1) easy to (5) difficult to navigate.</h2>
        <div class="Competitor_img"></div>
      </div>

      <div class="Guerilla">
        <h1>Guerilla Usability Testing</h1>
        <h2>As researchers, we wanted to understand users' pain points and find the root cause while navigating the CRA website. Therefore, we conducted five guerilla usability tests with the current CRA websites, and we requested participants to navigate and find the tax return information using main navigation and breadcrumbs.</h2>

        <h1>Identifying and Prioritizing</h1>
        <h2>We reviewed the recordings of the tests and jotted down each user's pain point onto a Post-It. Then we prioritized each pain point based on its importance to the user as well as its importance to the CRA.</h2>
        <div class="priority"></div>
      </div>

      <div class="Findings">
        <h5 class="card-header">Pain point 1</h5>
        <div class="card-body">
          <h5 class="card-title">Users had difficulties finding the CRA relevant contents in the main navigation</h5>
          <p class="card-text">The website is not exclusive to the CRA, which is hard to recognize instantly. When users click the main navigation, they get confused because the primary contents in this navigation belong to Canada.ca. Even the primary contents don't mention Canada Revenue Agency. We found that our participants hesitated after selecting the main navigation due to this matter, and they asked, "Isn't this website for the CRA itself?"</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="Findings">
        <h5 class="card-header">Pain point 2</h5>
        <div class="card-body">
          <h5 class="card-title">Users couldn't exit from the current page to the CRA main page</h5>
          <p class="card-text">There is no exit to the CRA main page. Users can only exit to the Canada.ca even using the breadcrumbs. While navigating the CRA website by clicking so many links, users felt stuck in the loop and struggled to find the way out.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="Findings">
        <h5 class="card-header">Pain point 3</h5>
        <div class="card-body">
          <h5 class="card-title">Unclear and complicated information architecture</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Due to too many sub-links and related links under one category, it is hard to recognize the hierarchy or contents groups. As a result, users felt tired and stressed when they had to find tax return information. The participants also mentioned that they prefer to google certain words and go to the exact page to avoid these struggles.</p>

          <h1>Digital Wireframes</h1>
          <h2>Based on the feedback and personal insights that I learned from the early sketches, I began to design my first digital wireframes using Adobe XD. I prioritized the feature that would address the need for easy and convenient navigation throughout the website.</h2>
          <div class="desktop_W"></div>
          <div class="mobile_W"></div>
          <h1>Usability Test and Iteration</h1>

      <div class="Findings">
        <h5 class="card-header">Improvement area 1</h5>
        <div class="card-body">
          <h5 class="card-title">Confusions on the sign-in part - Desktop</h5>
          <p class="card-text">When the participants got the task of finding the business account sign-in menu, they all clicked the CRA ID sign-in for a personal account. I discovered that the sign-in design needs to be reiterated with more contrast of colour and shades to give more clarity. </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="Findings">
        <h5 class="card-header">Improvement area 2</h5>
        <div class="card-body">
          <h5 class="card-title">Hover effect - Desktop</h5>
          <p class="card-text">I got the feedback that the hover effect on the navigation bar with a small circle is not convincing for the government website. So, to make a more convincing effect and for better consistency, I redesigned the hover effect with the main-coloured bar. </p>

      </div>

      <div class="Findings">
        <h5 class="card-header">Improvement area 3</h5>
        <div class="card-body">
          <h5 class="card-title">White space - Mobile</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Compared to the desktop version, participants felt a lack of white space in my mobile design. Therefore, I decided to give more space to each card UI pattern so that it could be more aesthetic.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="Findings">
        <h5 class="card-header">Improvement area 4</h5>

          <h5 class="card-title">Consistency - Mobile</h5>
          <p class="card-text">While testing, I found some parts missing the consistency between the desktop and mobile versions. I reiterated the mobile version for consistency.</p>
